Blog posts will outline the analysis I am conducting and link to resources, data, and other github repositories. I hope this notebook not only documents and improves my own work, but advances the capabilities and knowledge of our scientific community.

The layout of the notebook will be simple: each post will contain one or more categories and the date the entry was written. Then, posts will be archived by category and date. This will allow easy jumping from related post to related post - effectively tracking my progress through time and topic. To access these archives, click the  My hope is that this will allow myself to and for others following along to easily connect the threads of my work.

Thank you for opening my lab notebook.

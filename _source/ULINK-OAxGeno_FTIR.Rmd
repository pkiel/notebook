# Overview

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a semi-quantitative technique that measures how much light a sample transmits (or absorbs) at each wavelength. Each covalent bond will absorb/transmit infrared light reflective of its stretching or bending mode. We can then use known regions (based on the molecular bonding of a substance) to characterize samples. I describe the methodology,the regions of interest, and review the literature of FTIR applied to corals in more detail in my previous post about the methodology, <a href="https://patrickmkiel.com/notebook/research/ftirReview/">which you can read here.</a>

Spectra were again captured in the UM Dept of Chemistry using their FTIR with an ATR accessory. Spectra were smoothed with a Savitzky-Golay filter fit with a 3rd order polynomial over 15 cm<sup>-1</sup> and subsequently baseline corrected using the OpenSpecy open source spectral package in R. All data fit the characteristic vibrations peaks of aragonite.

# Samples

The corals for this analysis come from the 2022 ULINK OA x Genotype experiment, where we cultured 4 genotypes of *A. cervicornis* in the Experimental Reef Aquarium under two pCO2 regimes, representing current and predicted 2100 ocean acidification scenarios. <a href="https://patrickmkiel.com/notebook/research/ulink2022GrowthAnalysis/">A complete analysis of culture conditions and observed growth is document here.</>

Below are some brief overview graphs which document the observed growth.

   `r capFig("Avg Daily Growth by Treatment")`
<img src="/notebook/images/ulinkGrowth2022/calcification graphs-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

   `r capFig("Avg Daily Growth Per Week by Genotype and Treatment")`
 
<img src="/notebook/images/ulinkGrowth2022/calcification graphs-3.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The mean calcification rate in the HCO2 group was mean 0.316 (SD = 0.139) mg/g/day, whereas the mean in the LCO2 group was 0.569 (SD = 0.237). A Student two-samples t-test showed that the difference was statistically significant, t(87) = -6.194, p < 0.0001, d = -1.314. On average, the ocean acidification group saw a 44% reduction in calcification rates.

When factoring in genotype and accounting for the lack of independence of multiple corals cultured in the same aquarium using a mixed effects model with the aquarium set as a random intercept, **Cheetos-B and SI-A had negligible decreases in calcification rate** (Cheetos-: -8 &#177; 9%, F=-0.91, p=0.98; SI-A: -13.7 &#177; 7.1%, F=-1.93, p=0.571), whereas **MB-C and AC-2 saw significant decreases in calcification rates** (AC-2: -39 &#177; 7.4%, F=-5.32; p<0.01;MB-C: -30 &#177; 7.5%, F=-4.05; p<0.05)

Thus, there are some obvious genet-specific responses:

1. Cheetos-B calcification rate was nearly identical across HCO2 and LCO2 groups. This genet also had high initial mortality and the worst survivorship rate throughout the experiment. It is entirely possible that this genotype did not do well in the aquariums and its diminished calcification rate is an effect of overall health and not treatment. The corals analyzed above only include corals that survived the length of the experiment and not the corals which died in the beginning of the experiment.

2. SI-A and AC-2 had the highest average calcification rates and there was no significant difference between these two genotypes. However, when you look at the effect of treatment within these genotypes (sensitivity), there is significant differences between them. Thus, fast growth and OA sensitivity mechanisms are distinct from one another.

3. When looking at just controls, the only significant different genotype is Cheetos-B. Thus, there is a difference in sensitivity to OA but no observable differences in ambient conditions.

When the data is grouped by the coral genotype, no interesting patterns emerge. There is no shift in the v1-v4 peaks, intensities are fairly consistent, and the FWHM of each peak is also within range for each peak. The asymetrical strethcing of carbonate (v3 peak ~ 1460) had the largest variability with peaks ranging from 1443-1480 and the greatest width 110-156, with the means tightly around 140. The intensity of the v2 to v4 peak was consistently around 3.0, indicating that there was no ACC present in the measured samples given the range of I2/I4 values presented in Beniash *et al.* 1997.

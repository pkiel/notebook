# Overview

Coral restoration efforts are expanding globally to enhance gene flow and coral cover on degraded reefs, aiming to buy time while climate change and poor water quality are systematically addressed (Suggett *et al.* 2024). These restoration programs have produced large-scale coral nurseries where hundreds of genetically distinct individuals ("genets") from various species are propagated in common-garden environments. Scientists have leveraged these opportune experiments to examine the relative performance of the genets under identical environmental conditions. This research has revealed the remarkable intraspecific phenotypic diversity within these populations (Kiel *et al.* 2023). Notably, there is a wide range of sensitivity to ocean acidification (OA) in the branching species *Acropora cervicornis*. Some genets show no physiological impairment or reduction in growth rates, while others experience significant reductions, often exceeding 40%. This study seeks to investigate whether a biophysical, form-function relationship underlies this observed intraspecific OA sensitivity.

A coral's shape is intimately linked to its physiological performance and, ultimately, survival. The colony geometry is molded by feedback loops with its environment and by competition with other species. Further, through acclimation strategies and phenotypic plasticity, fine-scale differences emerge across a continuous spectrum. These morphological diversities are likely to have ecologically relevant effects and arise from selective pressures from hydrodynamic stresses (Madin 2005) as well as optimizations for particle capture (Helmuth and Sebens 1993), photosynthetic performance (Hoogenboom *et al.* 2008; Kramer *et al.* 2022), and mass-transfer of physiologically-limiting metabolites, e.g., O2, pH, and dissolved inorganic carbon (Lesser *et al.* 1994; Mass *et al.* 2010). Therefore, the balance of these tradeoffs and competition among benthic organisms results in the tremendous morphological diversity observed on coral reefs (Chappell 1980).

A given morphology can be described on a continuous scale, borrowing insights from geometry to integrate across morphological variation (Reichert *et al.* 2017; Zawada *et al.* 2019a). Zawada *et al.* (2019a) propose six metrics to constrain coral shape: sphericity and convexity (capturing volume compactness), packing and fractal dimension (capturing surface complexity), and the first moments of area and volume (capturing top-heaviness). 
Ultimately, the goal is to understand how each of these shape descriptors physically interacts with the coral's environment and spurs physiological or ecological consequences. Of particular interest are the surface complexity metrics as these relate to the turbulence of water flow at the coral's surface and influence mass flux (Stocking *et al.* 2018; Hossain and Staples 2020b, 2020a). 

Corals with complex surfaces will experience increased turbulence and develop smaller microenvironments or diffusion boundary layers (DBL). These microenvironments arise from the localized attenuation of fluid flow at the coral’s surface. Advection is slowed or completely halted at these scales, and the diffusion rate dominates mass transfer (Patterson 1992; Shashar *et al.* 1996). Further, corals alter the chemistry of the microenvironment through the changing balance of light-mediated carbon processes, including photosynthesis, respiration, calcification, and dissolution (Albright *et al.* 2015; Silbiger and Sorte 2018). During the day, a positive photosynthesis-to-respiration ratio increases dissolved oxygen (DO) and reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. During the night, photosynthesis is halted, and there is a net decrease in DO and an increase in CO2. 

For example, Shashar *et al.* (1993) observed an oxygen microenvironment around the relatively smooth species *Favia favus* and measured oxygen concentrations greater than 300% air saturation in light and nearly complete anoxia in darkness. Similarly, Kühl *et al.* (1995) measured pH changes ± 0.5 units from bulk conditions under light and darkness within a 300 μm DBL. On the other hand, comparably rougher, branching species exhibited marginal to non-measureable metabolic changes in microenvironment oxygen and pH due to the elevated turbulence and mass flux (Kühl *et al.* 1995; Chan *et al.* 2016; Schoepf *et al.* 2018; Comeau *et al.* 2019). A conceptual figure summarizing these results is presented in Figure 1 below.

```

The role of these microenvironments in modulating a coral’s response to OA ultimately relies on this discrete water volume influencing the calcifying fluid carbonate chemistry. The calcifying fluid (cf) is originally seawater, which has been partially closed off in cell junctions between the calicoblastic cells and the skeleton and is the ultimate source of carbon and ions for calcification (Allemand *et al.* 2011; Tambutté *et al.* 2011). Since the microenvironment envelops the coral colony and is the external seawater most proximal to the calcifying fluid, its concentration likely plays a role in shaping the calcifying fluid carbonate chemistry. Further, the calcifying fluid aragonite saturation state ($\Omega_{cf}$) repeats the species-specific microenvironment pH pattern, with rough *Acropora sp.* having a reduced mean and diel variability than a comparably smoother *Pocillopora damicornis* (DeCarlo *et al.* 2019). Finally, the microenvironment is the center of the proton flux hypothesis, which postulates that OA reduces coral calcification due to the reduced diffusive flux of protons out of the calcifying fluid and across the microenvironment with increasing bulk seawater acidification (Jokiel 2011). Therefore, rougher corals with elevated mass flux rates may be able to overcome OA stress.

# Methods

This experiment exposed three *A. cervicornis* genets to either long-term low CO2 (LCO2; pH = 8.05) or high CO2 (HCO2; pH = 7.80) experimental aquarias, with replication of genets and treatments.Corals were collected from the [University of Miami/Rescue a Reef coral nursery](https://rescueareef.earth.miami.edu/), and the experiment was run at the [Experimental Reef Laboratory](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/experimental-reef-lab/) run by NOAA/University of Miami's Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies. A graphical overview of the experiment is presented in Figure 2.

Growth rates were monitored weekly via the buoyant weight technique and were standardized to total surface area determined by structured-light three-dimensional scanner. Reproduced 3D models were also used to calculate shape variables following methods outlined in Reichert *et al.* (2017) and Zawada *et al.* (2019a). A principal components analysis was used to identify the shape variables that described the most variation within the data.

Following the four-month treatment, apical tips representing new skeletal growth exclusively grown during treatment were sectioned and prepared for geochemical analyses to serve as proxies for the pH of the calcifying fluid.

Eighteen randomly selected skeletons (n= 3/treatment/genet) were left intact following the growth phase to perform particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle tracking telemetry (PTV) analyses to calculate turbulence statistics around the coral colonies. Further, the 3D models were analyzed with computational fluid dynamics to calculate three-dimensional turbulence statistics and aid the PIV/PTV analyses. These data are still being collected and analyzed, and only a sample plot is produced.

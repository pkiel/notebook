  Welcome to my Open Lab Notebook!
</div>

In this open lab notebook, I seek to commit to open science through my data, methodology, and analyses. This notebook was inspired by <a href='https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook' target='_blank'>Holly Putnam</a>. 

Blog posts will outline the analysis I am conducting and link to resources, data, and other github repositories. I hope this notebook improves not only my own abilities, but advances the capabilities and knowledge of our scientific community.

Thank you for opening my lab notebook.

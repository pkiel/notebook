# Overview

Thank you for checking out my poster at the
<a href="https://www.microscalemeeting.org/about-the-meeting.html" target="_blank">Microscale
Ocean Biophysics Meeting 7.0 at Heron Island, Australia.</a> My poster
is titled, “Surface Roughness Induces Intraspecific Ocean Acidification
Resistance”.

Coral restoration efforts are growing globally to increase gene flow,
coral cover, and , all in an attempt to buy time while climate change
and. The systematic investigation of these has highlighted the
tremendous inter and intraspecific phyenotypic diversity naturally
present within coral populations. While much of the community is
focussed on understanding the molecular roles underlying these
phenotype-genotype relationships, there is much to learn from the corals
themselves.

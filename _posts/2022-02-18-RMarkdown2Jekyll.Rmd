## R Markdown

I am testing the capabilities of creating a document in RMarkdown and then knitting to my GitHub notebook. I plan to do this to share my data analyses.



```{r cars}
head(mtcars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(wt,mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

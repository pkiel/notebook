  Hey there! Welcome to my lab notebook.
</p>

My name is Patrick and I am a PhD student at the Rosenstiel School's Marine Biology and Ecology program researching ecological mechanics, biomineralization, and ecological restoration of coral reefs. I began my graduate studies in January 2022 in <a href='https://www.marinebiophysics.org/' target ='_blank'>Dr. Vivek N. Prakash's lab</a>. My other advisors include <a href='https://accesslabumiami.com/' target='_blank'>Dr. Prannoy Suraneni, <a href='https://www.coral.noaa.gov/people/ian-enochs.html' target='_blank'>Dr. Ian Enochs</a>, and <a href='https://marine-biology-ecology.rsmas.miami.edu/research-themes/centers-and-labs/benthic-ecology-coral-restoration-lab/people/diego-lirman/index.html' target='_blank'>Dr. Diego Lirman</a>. Prior to matriculating at RSMAS, I worked as an intern in NOAA's AOML Coral Program and completed my undergraduate eduation at the University of Miami.

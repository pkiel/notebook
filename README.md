# Patrick Kiel Open Lab Notebook

Welcome to my Open Lab Notebook. Inspired by [Holly Putnam](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook), I built this open notebook wih the Jekyll Theme Lanyon.

## Lanyon

Lanyon is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just fork and start writing. Lanyon was [forked from Github](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). 

I edited the base Lanyon theme with inspiration from other Jekyll themes including [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and edits that Holly Putnam employed for categorizing posts by category, tag, and date.


## Open Science
Open Sience is the movement to make research more accessible, understandable, and reproducible. Open science is based on the principles of transparency and translating research results into improvements of everyone's life regardless of educational background, race, or nationality. Further as an interdisciplinary ecologist, open science is particularly useful to foster collaborations and ensure accountability as I delve into multiple fields.

## Lanyon

Lanyon is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server. Lanyon was [forked from Github](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). 

I edited the theme using a combination of other Jekyll themes including [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and edits that Holly Putnam employed for categorizing posts by category, tag, and date.


## Open Science
Open Sience is the movement within science to make research more accessible, understandable, and reproducible. Open science is based on the principles of transparency and open-access. As an interdisciplinary ecologist, open science is particularly useful to foster collaborations and ensure accountability as I delve into multiple fields.
